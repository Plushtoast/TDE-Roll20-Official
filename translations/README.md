# TDE Sheet Translations
Only english and german will be officially supported. 
Other languages require the attention of voluntary helpers for completeness and correctness.

To see current problems with translations, please have a look at the [error.md](error.md) file.
It'll show obsolete keys (not required anymore) and missing keys (sheet probably got some more functions).

If you like to help please leave a pull request with the updated translation. Thank you.
